I made this project to learn more about mobile development with Flutter. The app allows the user to create an account, authenticate, and perform CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete. It is possible to register several celestial bodies with different attributes, such as Planets, Galaxies, and Stars. The app connects with a backend made in Node.js with a PostgreSQL database.

### Installation and usage

1. [Install Flutter and the Android SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux)
2. To run the app, run a device emulator or connect an Android smartphone via USB with the developer mode and USB debugging mode turned on
3. On the folder `flutter_app/` run the command `flutter run` to execute in debug mode or `flutter run --release` to execute the release version.
